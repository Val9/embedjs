Building mobile applications with embedjs
=========================================

embedjs takes a new approach to writing web applications. As we all know, most 
JavaScript libraries ship the entire codebase to the client whereas we think that the browser should
not worry about whether he supports something or not.

embedjs instead only ships the code the browser needs, resulting in incredibly performance code,
a maintainable code structure and the possibility to target different devices with different features.
